How many people have been dreaming of making the world more interoperable. Some history of the semantic web. The re-birth of the field in the shape of the **knowledge graph**. How some people push fairly grand visions for the future, while others try to just get something started.

# The dream of the semantic web
_A machine-readable web where automatic agents are on the same footing as humans, as content is designed to be consumed by them. Linking data sources. Improved collaboration through annotation._
# Knowledge graphs
_A re-brand of many existing things that has been gaining popularity fast. Some recent knowledge graphs and the big splashes they've made. Connecting disparate data sources within organizations._
# Semantic publishing
_Two competing visions: genuine semantic publishing vs. semantic publishing. Have the authors release semantic content vs. annotate the paper products they release. Some tools and ideas from the former realm, some from the latter._
# Clinical knowledge graphs
_Some of the ontologies that have been proposed in the sector. Cochrane's and MAGIC's effort for their own internal knowledge graph._
