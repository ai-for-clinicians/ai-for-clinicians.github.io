Title: About the project
Date: 2021-07-16 15:30
This series of blog posts is the result of a research project supported by the [Canisius-Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis (CWZ)](https://www.cwz.nl/), a hospital in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, which was initiated by [Dr. Jan Schouten](https://www.cwz.nl/patient/zorgprofessionals/schouten-j-1/) and [Prof. Martha Larson](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/larson-m/) from Radboud University.

Frustrated by the gap between research and practice and the negative effects it can have on patients, Dr. Schouten turned to Prof. Larson to survey the suitability of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence to improve the situation.

The initial product of this project is this website, which summarizes the essential challenge of changing a system as complicated as the one that governs how health evidence is produced, synthesized and disseminated. While lots of innovative technologies exist, what is missing is a project to consolidate them. We present a vision for this system based on a collaboratively edited knowledge graph.

There is also a presentation that covers the contents of this page. <span style='color:blue'>Todo: add link to presentation once done</span>.
