@article{Boutron2020,
abstract = {Objectives: This article presents why the planning, conduct, and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of therapeutic interventions are suboptimal. Study Design and Setting: We present an overview of the limitations of the current system of evidence synthesis for therapeutic interventions. Results: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are a cornerstone of health care decisions. However, despite the increasing a number of published systematic reviews of therapeutic interventions, the current evidence synthesis ecosystem is not properly addressing stakeholders' needs. The current production process leads to a series of disparate systematic reviews because of erratic and inefficient planning with a process that is not always comprehensive and is prone to bias. Evidence synthesis depends on the quality of primary research, so primary research that is not available is biased or selectively reported raises important concerns. Moreover, the lack of interactions between the community of primary research producers and systematic reviewers impedes the optimal use of data. The context has considerably evolved, with ongoing research innovations, a new medical approach with the end of the one-size-fits-all approach, more available data, and new patient expectations. All these changes must be introduced into the future evidence ecosystem. Conclusion: Dramatic changes are needed to enable this future ecosystem to become user driven and user oriented and more useful for decision-making.},

@article{Lu2011,
abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the modern advances of high-throughput technology and rapid growth of research capacity in producing large-scale biological data, both of which were concomitant with an exponential growth of biomedical literature. This wealth of scholarly knowledge is of significant importance for researchers in making scientific discoveries and healthcare professionals in managing health-related matters. However, the acquisition of such information is becoming increasingly difficult due to its large volume and rapid growth. In response, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is continuously making changes to its PubMed Web service for improvement. Meanwhile, different entities have devoted themselves to developing Web tools for helping users quickly and efficiently search and retrieve relevant publications. These practices, together with maturity in the field of text mining, have led to an increase in the number and quality of various Web tools that provide comparable literature search service to PubMed. In this study, we review 28 such tools, highlight their respective innovations, compare them to the PubMed system and one another, and discuss directions for future development. Furthermore, we have built a website dedicated to tracking existing systems and future advances in the field of biomedical literature search. Taken together, our work serves information seekers in choosing tools for their needs and service providers and developers in keeping current in the field. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},
