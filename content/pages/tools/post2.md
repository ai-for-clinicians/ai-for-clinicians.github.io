Title: A plethora of tools
Date: 2021-07-15 15:30
Summary: How many people have built lots of tools to make **search** as well as **evidence synthesis** easier and faster. What good ideas they already had. How tools still fall short of what clinicians and reviewers need. How developing tools is often hard, as previous work cannot be re-used. How we do not know how design decisions affect search outcomes.

How many people have built lots of tools to make **search** as well as **evidence synthesis** easier and faster. What good ideas they already had. How tools still fall short of what clinicians and reviewers need. How developing tools is often hard, as previous work cannot be re-used. How we do not know how design decisions affect search outcomes.

# Evidence search
_Trialstreamer and the whole list of products we discovered. More controlled search queries thanks to PICO indexing. Filtering by resource type (e.g. clinical trial)._
# Evidence synthesis
_Making it easier to produce systematic reviews and guidelines. Active learning technology such as ASReview. Data extraction tools such as RobotReviewer. Great potential for AI._
# Evaluating current tools
_In the search area, we can discuss what J and his colleague find to be useful features in their evaluation. In the evidence synthesis area, we find that many useful functionalities are already there, but isolated and spread across products, yielding a frustrating user experience that prevents further up-take. We also find a distinct potential for re-using existing work that is currently not leveraged. A more detailed comparison will be linked to via [separate page](engine-comparison.html)._
# Building tools is hard
_To create a useful tool, there is usually a lot of up-front work required, ingesting huge and ever-growing corpora of research documents, pre-processing to apply certain techniques, such as named entity recognition or article classification. A tool then needs to be maintained, which is costly and requires manual effort. Frequently, tools are created as offshoots from temporally limited research projects, so once the funding runs out, support does too. In a risk-averse sector such as health care, this tenuous situation further hampers up-take._
