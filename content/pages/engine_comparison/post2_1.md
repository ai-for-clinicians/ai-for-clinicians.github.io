Date: 2021-07-15 15:30

Here, we provide a high-level comparison of a number of innovative clinical search engines. These are:

* **Trialstreamer**: An innovative approach that combines a number of novel machine-learning based methods promising to deliver more precise results.
* **Trip Database / Evidence Maps**: A system that has been in the field for more than 20 years and combines a large collection independent of MEDLINE with innovative features, such as the evidence maps prototype.
* **DOC Search**: A commercial offering that relies on a number of machine-learning based methods similar to Trialstreamer.
* **Cochrane PICOfinder**: A system developed by one of the long-term leaders in the field that is based on a solid conceptualization of the domain using a knowledge graph.
* **ScAIView**: An academic, general-purpose search engine prototypical of a larger body of work that uses named entity recognition to guide retrieval.

We first first present an overview in a product-feature matrix and then portray each tool in turn.
