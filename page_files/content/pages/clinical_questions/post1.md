Date: 2021-07-15 15:30
Summary: How clinicians currently search relevant clinical evidence to help their patients. Why systematic reviews and guidelines are really important to them, but frequently outdated. How creating these documents is a meticulous, time-consuming process and why they're outdated when they come out already. How the **evidence ecosystem** is not meeting the needs of stakeholders: Precise, relevant information that helps my particular patient.

# Purpose
How clinicians currently search relevant clinical evidence to help their patients. Why systematic reviews and guidelines are really important to them, but frequently outdated. How creating these documents is a meticulous, time-consuming process and why they're outdated when they come out already. How the **evidence ecosystem** is not meeting the needs of stakeholders: Precise, relevant information that helps my particular patient.

# What answers clinicians need

_We could ask J to provide us with some example questions that he's been researching. Generally, there will be a particular patient that they want to diagnose or help to get better. More evidence than ever, so impossible to know it all, need to be able to find it when needed. A textbook [@Hersh2020] makes a number of relevant distinctions: background vs foreground questions (general vs tied to a particular patient), recognized vs unrecognized need (clinician needs to know that they should search), met vs unmet need (might be unmet because never pursued)._


# What resources are available

_4S model: Hierarchy of sources. Different types are found in different places, e.g. Pubmed indexed a large number of studies and syntheses, but has no synopses, these might instead be in specialist sources like Uptodate and Dynamed._

# The evidence ecosystem
_Hierarchy of sources, primary care providers want aggregated information, big picture view, a single study shouldn't sway their decisions. Whole ecosystem with systematic reviews and guidelines that they can rely on. Big picture view of how the process works._

# Meeting the needs of stakeholders

_The whole issue with the evidence ecosystem that have been established. Clinicians frequently don't search, because they don't think an answer even exists. Crucial resources are outdated because their creation is so complicated. Many questions in fact don't have a review that covers them. Reviews are often duplicated and of poor quality._
