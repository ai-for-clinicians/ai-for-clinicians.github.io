    <h1>A common infrastructure</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="Infrastructure icon" src="/images/building-4-line.png" style="max-width:25%"></p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>How many people have been dreaming of making the world more interoperable. Some history of the semantic web. The re-birth of the field in the shape of the <strong>knowledge graph</strong>. How some people push fairly grand visions for the future, while others try to just get something started.</p>
<h1>The dream of the semantic web</h1>
<p>It's easy to forget how recent of an innovation the world wie web truly is, given how much dominance it has gained over how we conduct our daily lives. Tim Berners-Lee created the underlying hypertext format in 1989, while working at the research institute CERN, explicitly aiming to improve the way that researchers access and exchange information. While the basic idea was to give them a way to easily refer to other documents via links, to create a connected web of documents, ever since then, extension to the basic underlying paradigm of marked-up documents being shared over the internet have been proposed, but none have been as successful as the web itself. Tim Berners-Lee himself proposed one such extension in 1999, having realized that much of the existing content of the web was only suitable for the consumption by humans, not by machines. In his vision for what later became know as the semantic web, the British computer scientist aimed to make the world wide web machine-readable, putting automatic agents on the same footing as humans,<br>
<em>A machine-readable web where automatic agents are on the same footing as humans, as content is designed to be consumed by them. Linking data sources. Improved collaboration through annotation.</em></p>
<h1>Knowledge graphs</h1>
<p><em>A re-brand of many existing things that has been gaining popularity fast. Some recent knowledge graphs and the big splashes they've made. Connecting disparate data sources within organizations.</em></p>
<h1>Semantic publishing</h1>
<p><em>Two competing visions: genuine semantic publishing vs. semantic publishing. Have the authors release semantic content vs. annotate the paper products they release. Some tools and ideas from the former realm, some from the latter.</em></p>
<h1>Clinical knowledge graphs</h1>
<p><em>Some of the ontologies that have been proposed in the sector. Cochrane's and MAGIC's effort for their own internal knowledge graph.</em></p>
