    <h1>Improving evidence search</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="Tool icon" src="/images/hammer-line.png" style="max-width:25%"></p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>How many people have built lots of tools to make <strong>evidence search</strong> easier and faster. What good ideas they already had. How tools still fall short of what clinicians and reviewers need. How developing tools is often hard, as previous work cannot be re-used. How we do not know how design decisions affect search outcomes.</p>
<h1>Evidence search engines</h1>
<p>How can clinicians answer a research question with relevant primary literature? They could run a search via PubMed, the most famous and widely used search engine for biomedical questions that is operated by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Thanks to its detailed human-curated indexing and article classification by study type, PubMed makes it possible to run fine-grained searches with high precision. PubMed has become an institutional standard, being mandated as one of the primary tools for running literature searches during the creation of systematic reviews. However, it is also somewhat unwieldy to use and necessarily less innovative than other vendors who offer a less well established product. For this reason, over the years, there have been countless efforts to build an evidence search engine that goes beyond what PubMed offers, adding functionalities such as automatic generation of indexing terms to reduce the time until new articles become indexed or machine-aided aggregation functions that do more than just retrieving abstracts of relevant articles. A 2011 survey<sup>[<a href="#reference1">1</a>]</sup> of 28 such search engines distinguishes four areas which they aim to improve, namely the ranking of search results, allowing a clustering of results by topic, extracting and displaying semantics and improving the search interface. Many of them have since been deprecated, but features and ideas first promoted by them have occasionally been added into PubMed itself. In the 10 years since the survey came out, the production of supposedly innovative clinical search engine prototypes has only accelerated. Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, teams all across the world raced to build search tools for helping clinicians find answers in the similarly rapidly expanding literature on the disease. A 2020 survey<sup>[<a href="#reference2">2</a>]</sup> identifies 30 search tools created in response to the pandemic, most of which indexed the same corpus and differ in implementation and design, with innovative features such as automatic summarization being mixed in in some instances.</p>
<p>Apparently, searching for the right search tool is a problem in its own right these days if one aims to maximize one's use of innovative technology. However, unfortunately proper evaluation of the utility of some of the proposed changes is very widespread. Most of the evaluation done up this point follows classical information retrieval paradigms, mostly trying to optimize the search engine's ability to rank documents deemed relevant to a given query higher than irrelevant ones, but failing to measure the actual effects that using the search engine has on clinical practice. Recent research<sup>[<a href="#reference3">3</a>]</sup> demonstrated that higher relevance scores obtained by intensive tweaking and optimization on behalf of the IR researchers did not help one search engine to outperform a simple baseline when it comes to actually improving how clinicians put to practice the results of their search. In other words, even though one search engine was ranking the most relevant documents higher than the other one, the conclusions that the clinicians derived had the same chance of being unfounded by the evidence. The authors find that beyond retrieving relevant documents, helping users understand the documents they're reading in context is a crucial ability of search engines that is overlooked in the current evaluation protocol.</p>
<h1>What clinicians expect of evidence search</h1>
<p>Clinicians have a clear mental model of what they consider to be important when analyzing the results of individual studies and reviews. For a quick overview of a primary paper, they analyze it according to its <strong>PICO</strong> characteristics, asking for <strong>population</strong>, <strong>intervention</strong>, <strong>comparator</strong> and <strong>outcome</strong>. For example, a study could compare statins (intervention) to placebo (comparator) in people at risk for cardiovascular disease (population) as to the incidence of heart attacks (outcome). Frequently, a paper is not fully described by a single PICO, but has multiple applicable PICOs (for example when multiple drugs are compared across multiple outcomes). Moreover, individual PICO slot fillers are usually much more complex (full inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients based on disease history or demographics could be included in <strong>P</strong>, interventions have a dosage regimen and outcomes are measured using different metrics and with different follow-up periods). Additionally, there are clear quality criteria for randomized controlled trials that clinicians pay attention to when conducting a critical appraisal. A paper's <strong>risk of bias</strong> (RoB) can be judged by answering questions from a checklist that looks into aspects such as randomization of trial participants to groups and blinding. All else being equal, studies enrolling a higher number of subjects are also more likely to give a correct estimate of the true effect, meaning clinicians will be on the lookout for how many people were enrolled and dropped out during a trial. </p>
<p>When performing search then, they are looking for trials that offer a good match to their research question, e.g. by having a match in terms of patient population and relevant outcomes, while being at a low risk of bias and enrolling as many subjects as possible. These criteria are the same as those used by the authors of systematic reviews, who use special formulas to compute a combined effect estimate by pooling results from individual trials and adjusting for risk of bias and sample size. A good evidence search engine should allow users to tailor queries by PICO characteristics, leveraging the hierarchy inherent in them to for example expand searches for a general term such as "cardiovascular disease" to subcategories such as "coronary heart disease". It should deliver relevant primary literature and secondary sources such as reviews, and offer a quick overview that can help clinicians to reduce the time spent searching, e.g. by displaying automatically extracted sample sizes and risk of bias estimates. In the limit, it could even be expected to generate an aggregated result view, doing away with a list of individual sources and their abstracts and instead presenting automatically designed meta-analyses that allow clinicians to side-step the systematic review. A system with this capability would be able to summarize the current state of the evidence for any research question doctors come up with and automatically deliver updated estimates whenever a new primary source becomes available. Doctors pained by outdated systematic reviews which take years to produce dream of being able to confidently adjust their estimates of the efficacy of the latest drugs on a monthly basis whenever new trials come out.</p>
<h1>Evaluating current systems</h1>
<p>How close are current tools to this vision? Can we fix the evidence-to-practice-gap with the ultimate search power tool? To evaluate current offerings, we delineated a number of criteria that clinicians value when performing a critical appraisal of the literature. We then combed through a large number of academic prototypes and commercial search engines with decades of market exposure, selecting a small set based on innovative features and market exposure.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we can distinguish five core criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coverage</strong>: Search engines should index as much evidence as possible, from a diverse array of sources. Content should become available as fast as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Search and filtering</strong>: Clinicians should be able to tailor search queries to their information need with methods such as querying for PICO terms from a standard vocabulary or filtering by article type.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation of results</strong>: There's much that can be done beyond just showing an ordered list of paper titles and abstracts, for example clinicians could benefits from a condensed view that shows the main findings of a study.</li>
<li><strong>User experience</strong>: Many convenience features such as subscribing to new results for a query, exporting results for other workflows matter to clinicians.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Has any evaluation of the system or its components been done? Especially when natural language processing systems are used to optimize the experience, we want the use of technology to be properly validated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the board, we find that many useful functionalities are already there, but isolated and spread across products, yielding a frustrating user experience that prevents up-take. A more detailed comparison can be found on <a href="engine-comparison.html">this page</a>.</p>
<h1>Building tools is hard</h1>
<p>What to do when you are not satisfied with the tools in the market? You build your own search engine. We can see this tendency in the literature, but we find the idea to be unsatisfying. It would be preferable to maintain a platform that allowed researchers to experiment with targeted ideas for improving particular features, efficiently re-use existing work from other areas, rather than having to build a sub-par version themselves. Your idea for a PICO extraction system might give much improved results, but what if the clunky search engine you need to build around it fails to interest outside parties? To create a useful tool, there is usually a lot of up-front work required, ingesting huge and ever-growing corpora of research documents, pre-processing to apply certain techniques, such as named entity recognition or article classification. A tool then needs to be maintained, which is costly and requires manual effort. Frequently, tools are created as offshoots from temporally limited research projects, so once the funding runs out, support does too. In a risk-averse sector such as health care, this tenuous situation further hampers up-take, as clinicians are wary of investing the time to learn to use a new tool that might be gone the next year. How can we change this situation? In the <a href="a-common-infrastructure.html">next post</a>, we ask how more standardization and interoperability could help.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
